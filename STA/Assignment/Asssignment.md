I'll update the specification to include a requirement for implementing the debugging system:

## Static Timing Analysis (STA) Implementation

### Overview

This project involves implementing a Static Timing Analysis (STA) tool for digital circuits. STA is a method used to calculate the expected timing of a digital circuit without requiring simulation. The implementation will analyze circuit netlists by performing topological traversal of the circuit graph, where nodes represent gates and edges represent wire connections.

### Background

Static Timing Analysis is essential for ensuring that digital circuits meet their timing requirements. It involves:

1. Forward traversal to calculate arrival times at each gate output
2. Backward traversal to calculate required arrival times
3. Computing slack values to identify critical paths
4. Determining the overall circuit delay

### Project Phases

#### Phase 0A: Liberty File Parsing

- Parse a liberty file (.lib) containing Non-Linear Delay Models (NLDMs)
- Extract gate types, their delay tables, and output slew tables
- Store this information in appropriate data structures

#### Phase 0B: Circuit Netlist Processing

- Parse a circuit netlist (.isc/.bench) file
- Build an adjacency list representation of the circuit
- Identify inputs, outputs, and internal gates
- Handle special elements like flip-flops (DFF)

#### Phase 1: Static Timing Analysis

Implement a complete static timing analysis pipeline that:

1. Calculates load capacitance for each gate
2. Performs forward traversal to compute delays and arrival times
3. Performs backward traversal to compute required times
4. Calculates slack at each gate output
5. Identifies the critical path

### Debugging System Requirements

The implementation must include a debugging system to aid in development and verification. The system should:

1. Support multiple debug levels (e.g., ERROR, WARN, INFO, DETAIL, TRACE)
2. Log messages to a file with timestamps
3. Include specialized tracing functions for key operations:
   - Interpolation calculations
   - Gate delay calculations
   - Circuit state dumps
   - Library information dumps

4. Be configurable at runtime and optionally disabled in release builds
5. Provide detailed information about critical calculations with appropriate context

At minimum, the debugging system should trace:
- Table lookup and interpolation calculations
- Gate delay and slew calculations, including scaling for n-input gates
- Node arrival time and required time calculations
- Critical path identification steps

### Technical Requirements

#### Input Format

The program should accept two command-line arguments:
1. Circuit netlist file path
2. Liberty file path

#### Output Format

The program should generate a file named `ckt_traversal.txt` containing:
```
Circuit delay: <val> ps
Gate slacks:
<gate_type>-<gate_id>: <slack_val> ps
...
Critical path:
<gate1>, <gate2>, ... <gateN>
```

#### NLDM Liberty File Format

The implementation will specifically handle the provided liberty file format, which has the following structure:

- Each gate type (NAND, NOR, AND, OR, XOR, INV/NOT, BUF/BUFF) has:
  - Input capacitance value
  - 7×7 cell_delay lookup table (LUT)
  - 7×7 output_slew lookup table (LUT)
  
- LUT format:
  - First index (index_1): input slew values in nanoseconds
  - Second index (index_2): load capacitance values in femtoFarads
  - Each LUT contains 49 values representing delay or output slew

#### Assumptions

- Arrival time at primary inputs: 0 ps
- Input slew at primary inputs: 2 ps
- Load capacitance at primary outputs: 4 × capacitance of an inverter
- Required arrival time: 1.1 × circuit delay
- For n-input gates (where n > 2), multiply the delay from the LUT by (n/2)
- No differentiation between rise and fall transitions
- For 1-input gates like INV, BUF, NOT, do not apply the multiplication factor

### Implementation Details

#### Library Handling
- Parse the liberty file to extract lookup tables for delays and output slew
- Implement 2D interpolation to handle input slew and load capacitance values not exactly matching table entries

#### 2D Interpolation
- Clamp input slew and load capacitance values only when finding the nearest table indices
- Use original unclamped values in the interpolation formula
- Follow the provided bilinear interpolation formula:
```
v = (v11(C2-C)(τ2-τ) + v12(C-C1)(τ2-τ) + v21(C2-C)(τ-τ1) + v22(C-C1)(τ-τ1)) / ((C2-C1)(τ2-τ1))
```

#### Gate Delay Calculation
- Calculate load capacitance for each gate as the sum of input capacitances of its fanout gates
- Use 2D interpolation for finding delay values from lookup tables
- Handle n-input gates by scaling the delay appropriately

#### Circuit Traversal
- Implement topological traversal for both forward and backward passes
- Handle DFFs by splitting them into dummy input and output nodes
- Calculate arrival time at each node using the max function
- Calculate required time at each node using the min function

#### Critical Path Identification
- Start from the primary output with minimum slack
- Trace backward, selecting inputs with minimum slack at each step

#### Dead Nodes
- For gates without fanout, set their load capacitance to the minimum value
- These nodes will not affect the critical path since they won't appear in the fanin cone of any output

### Implementation Guidance

1. Use appropriate data structures (maps, vectors) for efficient lookup and traversal
2. Pass complex objects by reference to improve performance
3. Only allocate memory as needed, avoiding static allocation for large circuits
4. Handle circuit sizes up to 150,000 gates
5. Ensure correctness on a range of circuits from small (e.g., c17) to large (e.g., b19_1)
6. Implement the debugging system to facilitate development and troubleshooting

### Circuit Format Example

```
INPUT(1)
INPUT(3)
OUTPUT(22)
13 = NOR (3, 1)
22 = NAND (13, 1)
```

This example has:
- Two input pads (1 and 3)
- One output pad (22)
- Two gates: a NOR gate (13) and a NAND gate (22)

Debugging Implementation Guidelines
The debugging system should be flexible enough to adapt to the data structures chosen by the implementer. Below are guidelines for implementing the debugging system:

Initialization:

The debugging system should be initialized at program startup
Accept a command-line flag or configuration file setting to determine debug level
Allow debug output to be directed to a file with appropriate naming based on the circuit


Debug Levels:

ERROR: Critical errors that prevent correct operation
WARN: Issues that may affect results but allow continued execution
INFO: Basic progress information (file loading, phase completion)
DETAIL: Intermediate calculation results and state transitions
TRACE: Full step-by-step tracing of all calculations


Key Logging Points:

Library file parsing (gate types, capacitance values, table dimensions)
Circuit netlist parsing (node IDs, gate types, connectivity)
Forward traversal calculations (per node):

Input slew propagation
Load capacitance calculation
Gate delay calculation including interpolation
Arrival time updates


Backward traversal calculations (per node):

Required time propagation
Slack calculation


Critical path identification


Data Visualization:

Provide methods to dump the state of key data structures
Format output for readability (aligned columns, appropriate precision)
Include context information (node IDs, gate types) with values


Performance Considerations:

Use conditional compilation to eliminate debug code in release builds
Ensure logging operations don't significantly impact performance

Integration with Solution
The debugging system should be integrated with the main STA implementation in a way that:

Provides useful information during development
Helps verify correctness of calculations
Facilitates troubleshooting when results don't match expectations
Can be easily enabled/disabled without modifying the core algorithm

Each phase of the STA algorithm (parsing, forward traversal, backward traversal, critical path) should include appropriate debug output at different levels to provide visibility into the internal operations while allowing control over the verbosity of the output.
